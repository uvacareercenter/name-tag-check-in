# Name Tag Check In

An internal web app for the UVA Career Center to facilitate event registration for Career Center events.

Uses React, Node.js, Auth0 and the DYMO Label Framework.

## Docs

- [Server setup for deployment](docs/server-setup.md)

## Requirements

Ensure you have the DYMO label software installed ([Windows](https://evetpractice.blob.core.windows.net/installs/DLS8Setup.8.7.3.exe) or [Mac](https://evetpractice.blob.core.windows.net/installs/DLS8Setup.8.7.3.dmg)). This is required to forward requests from your browser to the printer. The application is usable without it, but any printing functionality will be disabled.

You will also need Node.js 10 or newer.

Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

In order for HTTPS to work in development, you'll need to create a local self-signed certificate. You can do this manually with tools like OpenSSL, but [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) makes this super simple:

```bash
mkcert -install
mkcert -cert-file cert.pem -key-file privkey.pem localhost
```

Create a `.env` file with the same fields as `.env.example`. All necessary Auth0 info should be obtained from their Application Setttings and API Settings dashboards.

## Development Usage

Run the Node development server (uses Nodemon for restart on changes)

```
npm run dev:server
```

Run the React development server

```
npm run dev:client
```

Run both in parallel

```
npm run dev
```

## Production Usage

Create a production build

```
npm run build
```

Run the Node server:

```
npm start
```

## Functionality

As soon as a user visits the site, they are required to authenticate. Internally, we have a username and password configured with Auth0 for usage for events.

Afterward, they must pick an event to use for submissions. Any existing events will display on the dialog as well as a form section to create new events. The "Event Name" value will be public-facing and cleansed for later use internally in the file name for generating a CSV. The "available options" are the different types of fields that users will be able to select when completing the form.

Once an event is chosen, the dialog will be closed and the app is ready to be used. Users are required to select at least one type (employer, alumni or parent) with which they identify, after which the appropriate form fields will appear. After clicking submit, a label with their info should print and their data should be sent to our internal server and saved to a CSV file.

## API Structure

All endpoints require an `Authorization` header with a valid Auth0 token. Any requests from React will be authenticated, but if you'd like to test manually you will need to [obtain your own access token](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/backend/nodejs/02-using#obtaining-an-access-token). The header should be set as `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN`

### `GET` `/api/events`
